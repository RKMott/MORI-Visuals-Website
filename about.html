                <h3>What is MORI About?</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm based in Bedford, right in the heart of the UK, where I split my time between gritty backstreets and dimly lit music venues — camera in hand, caffeine on standby. This isn’t just a hobby or a side hustle; it’s a daily pursuit to freeze those raw, blink-and-you-miss-it moments that make street life and live music so electric. Whether it’s the glint of neon off rain-soaked pavement or the sweat and chaos of a dive bar gig, I chase what feels real — unfiltered, unscripted, and unapologetically alive.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Photography, for me, is about doing justice to the details most people scroll past. I’m drawn to textures, movement, the clash between light and shadow — all the things that make a scene feel like it’s breathing. When I shoot, I’m not interested in perfect smiles or staged poses. I’m there to catch the mood, the mess, the energy — because that’s where the story lives.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    This whole journey kicked off when I realized how many incredible artists, moments, and cultures were being flattened into forgettable snapshots. Since then, I’ve been on a mission to create something that hits harder — images that feel like the moment, not just record it. If you're in a band that wants to be shot with the same intensity you bring to the stage, or you're looking for visuals that actually say something, we’ll probably get on well.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    So whether it’s a midnight walk through the city or a basement gig that shakes the floor, I’ll be there — documenting it with a sharp eye and a deep respect for the stories behind every frame.
                </p>

                <h3>Freqently Asked Questions</h3>

                <div class="faqBox">
                    <h4>What types of photography do you specialise in?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I focus on capturing the raw energy and real moments across live music, street photography, portraits, events, and lifestyle shoots. Whether it’s a packed venue, a quiet city corner, or a personal session, I aim to tell stories through every frame. However, this doesn't stop me from reaching out into other areas, whether that be shooting a music video or promotional shots for movie bill boards.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqBox">
                    <h4>Do you travel for shoots?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Absolutely. While I’m based in Bedford, I’m more than happy to travel for the right project — whether it's across town or across the country. Let’s talk details and make it happen.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqBox">
                    <h4>Can we collaborate on a creative concept?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Yes, 100%. I’m all about bringing ideas to life. If you’ve got a mood, story, or aesthetic in mind, I’ll help shape it into something that looks and feels true to you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqBox">
                    <h4>How do I book a session?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Drop me a message through the contact page or reach out via socials. Let me know what you’re after, and I’ll get back to you with availability, pricing, and a plan to make it work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faqBox">
                    <h4>How long does it take to get the photos back?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Turnaround is usually 1–2 weeks, depending on the project size. I always make sure the final edits are worth the wait — no rushed jobs, just solid work.</p>
